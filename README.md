Customerior is an application which will be working on market basket analysis i.e. analyzing customer buying habits by finding association between different items that a customer places in their shopping basket.

Apriori was the first proposed algorithm in association rule mining to identify all the frequent itemsets in the large going to collect information from the database  and creates an optimized data structure as Conditional pattern. 
Initially it Scans  the transaction database DB once and Collects the set of frequent items F and their supports and then forms the frequent itemsets as L, based on the support count.
The above step is then repeated for a set of 2 and 3 items to generate L2 and L3 respectively
Strong Association rules are then determined based on this

# Conclusion
This project has helped us study customer buying patterns by Apriori Algorithm based on market basket analysis. We have been able to understand how a shopkeeper can arrange his assortments in a way encouraging the customer to buy more.
